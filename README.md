## Installation Instructions

To set up and run this MERN stack application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Vansh-Dwivedi/AccountsManagement.git
   cd AccountsManagement
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   npm install
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add necessary variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret)
   - Create a `.env.development.local` file in the `client` directory and add `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`

4. Start the development servers:
   - For the client: `npm run client:start`
   - For the server: `npm run server:start`

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser

## Additional Instructions

- To build the application for production:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or provide a valid MongoDB URI in the server's `.env` file.

- The Socket.io connection for real-time chat is now correctly configured. Ensure that the server is running on the expected port (default: 5000) for the chat functionality to work properly.

- The passwords for all users are:
   ```
   managerfirst: man (email: man@man.com)
   cli5: cli5 (email: cli5@cli5.com)
   cli4: cli4 (email: cli4@cli4.com)
   adminfirst: adi (email: adi@adi.com)

   Pattern: {username}{password}{email}
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional features for each user role using React and Express
2. Optimize performance and scalability of the chat system
3. Continue to refine and enhance the user interface and experience

We're excited to announce that the chat functionality, including the unread message notification bubble, is now fully operational. The application's styles have been significantly improved while maintaining responsiveness across various devices. These enhancements contribute to a more polished and user-friendly experience. Thank you for your patience, and we hope you enjoy using our enhanced MERN stack application!
